<!-- WRITE: Main content about the seven assessment types -->

## Content to write:

- Introduction to the seven assessment types
- Explain that these map directly to BS EN 14960:2019 requirements
- Describe how each assessment works (forms with pass/fail/N/A options and comment fields)
- Mention that all assessments are linked to one inspection
- Note that the system guides inspectors through each assessment type
- Explain how the assessments contribute to the overall pass/fail determination

## The seven assessment types to describe:

1. **User Height Assessment**: Calculate maximum user heights and capacity based on dimensions
2. **Slide Assessment**: Slide run-out measurements and safety checks
3. **Structural Assessment**: Overall structural integrity checks
4. **Anchorage Assessment**: Anchor point calculations and requirements
5. **Materials Assessment**: Fabric strength, thread, netting, ropes, zips, windows, artwork checks
6. **Enclosed Assessment**: Special checks for totally enclosed units
7. **Fan Assessment**: Blower/fan specifications and safety

## Features to list:

- Seven distinct assessment forms covering all safety aspects
- Pass/fail/N/A options with comment fields for each check
- Automatic calculations for user capacity and anchor points
- Inline standards documentation within each assessment
- Draft mode allows incomplete assessments to be saved and continued later
- All assessments link to a single inspection report
