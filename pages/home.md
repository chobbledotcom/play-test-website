**Play-Test is an online test database for play equipment. Users can store inspections to the BS EN 14960 standard and share PDF reports for units or inspections.**

The platform is **open source and available to all** ([here's the source code on Github](https://github.com/chobbledotcom/play-test)). Its development processes are collaborative, transparent, and independent.

The lead developer is [Stefan from Chobble.com](https://chobble.com), formerly a developer at [The Bouncy Castle Network](https://www.bouncycastlenetwork.com) and [Bandcamp.com](https://bandcamp.com).
