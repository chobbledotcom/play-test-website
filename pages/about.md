## Content to write:

### What is play-test?

- Comprehensive explanation of what the system does
- Why it exists (gap in the market, need for open tooling)
- What problem it solves for inspectors

### Who is it for?

- Individual inspectors
- Inspection companies
- Industry bodies and training organisations
- Equipment operators who want inspection records

### The Open Source Difference

- **Emphasise: Code owned by the commons, not any manufacturer or industry body**
- Explain why this matters (no vendor lock-in, transparency, community ownership)
- No commercial interests driving feature decisions
- Neutral and independent
- Anyone can contribute, improve, or audit the code

### Standards Compliance

- Currently: BS EN 14960:2019 (inflatable play equipment)
- Future: Plans to cover more related specs for play structures
- Standards embedded, not bolted on
- Regular updates as standards evolve

### Development & Sponsorship

- RPII (Recreational and Play Inspectors Ireland) sponsorship
- What this sponsorship means for the project
- Built by Chobble (mention your experience - link to cv)
- Community-driven development
