**Play-Test needs your support.** Launching new software is a daunting task, especially when there are established players in the market, and when you're a solo developer, and when you're building an open-source project.

## If you can spare some cash

You can donate to Chobble in the name of Play-Test's development through any of the links below:

- **OpenCollective**: opencollective.com/play-test
- **LiberaPay**: liberapay.com/chobble
- **Patreon**: patreon.com/c/Chobble

## If you want to pay to use the platform

You can [contact Chobble](https://chobble.com/chobble/) to pay for an account on the Chobble instance of Play-Test, at [play-test.co.uk](https://play-test.co.uk). Prices are **£5/month for unlimited inspections**, paid annually.

You can also pay Chobble to host a full private instance for you or your team, at **£200 per month** for unlimited users, inspections, and 2 hours of support time per month.

## If you are a bouncy castle hirer

Please consider using an inspector who stores their tests on Play-Test, or ask your inspector if they've considered it.

## If you test bouncy castles

Please consider trying the Play-Test platform out, or at least talking to your peers about the potential benefits to the industry of the existence of an open source, community-driven testing platform.

## If you run your own testing database or web service

Please consider contributing to the Play-Test system or integrating it with your platform. Its open source license ensures that your contributions go towards the public good, and nothing about Play-Test stands in the way of other business from making money.

**But remember - if you run a modified version of Play-Test for others to use, its AGPLv3 license means you must share your source code too.**
