**If you are a bouncy castle or inflatable play equipment inspector, you'll hopefully find the Play-Test system really easy to use.**

At its core the system is about creating two types of records - _Unit_ records for individual pieces of equipment, and _Inspection_ records for those _Units_.

Repeat _Inspection_ records can be entered really easily, because the system pre-fills the information from the last completed _Inspection_.

You can **generate PDFs** for either _Units_ or _Inspections_, and share them with **QR Codes** - you could even **attach physical badges to equipment** to link them to their _Unit_ records!

The platform is currently geared up to check against the **BS EN 14960** standard, and gives some useful feedback on specifics of the standard, like telling you whether the measurements you entered line up with your pass/fail statuses.

## Community-driven

It's only early days for the Play-Test system. Future plans are on the [roadmap](/roadmap/) and include support for more safety standards, translations, and maybe an "end user" login system.

To be successful, the platform will need the active involvement of the play equipment inspection community. To that end, users are encouraged to leave feedback through the link once you log in.

## Open source

Play-Test is an open source platform, which means the code is freely available for anyone to use, copy, and modify. If someone disagrees with how the platform is being developed, they can make their own version and take it in a different direction - this is completely allowed and even encouraged by the license.

The specific license used (called AGPLv3) has an important rule: if anyone makes changes to the software and runs it online for others to use, **they must share those changes publicly**. This prevents companies or organisations from taking the code, improving it, and then keeping those improvements secret. This helps ensure that the platform continues to benefit inspectors and the public, rather than becoming a closed system controlled by any single entity.
